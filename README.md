## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save code-of-conduct
```

## Why?

I'm using this to programmatically lint my own GitHub repostories for Code of Conduct files, to:

1. Ensure that the file exists
2. Ensure that the file is consistently named across all of my projects
3. Check the contents to ensure it is up-to-date

## Usage

Get a code of conduct file from the current working directory.

```js
var coc = require('code-of-conduct');
console.log(coc());
//=> '/dev/some-project/code-of-conduct.md'
```

Get the code of conduct file from the specified directory:

```js
console.log(coc('my-projects/foo'));
//=> '/dev/my-projects/foo/code-of-conduct.md'
```

## File patterns

Detects all of the following file patterns (`node_modules` is ignored):

```
**/coc
**/coc.md
**/code-of-conduct
**/code-of-conduct.md
**/code_of_conduct
**/code_of_conduct.md
**/contributor-covenent
**/contributor-covenent.md

```
